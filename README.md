# Scarab

Scarab is a lightweight web routing framework built on Sinatra, similar to
Sinatra's "namespace" plugin.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scarab', git: 'https://github.com/Co-Chu/Scarab'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

```ruby
require 'scarab'

class UserController < Scarab::Controller('/users')
    get do # GET /users
        # do something here...
    end

    get '/:id' do # GET /users/:id
        # do something here...
    end
end

class SessionController < Scarab::Controller('/sessions')
    post do # POST /sessions
        # do something here...
    end

    delete '/:id' do # DELETE /sessions/:id
        # do something here...
    end
end

Scarab::App.run
```

Controllers and apps are just normal Sinatra modular applications and should be
able to use anything that you would expect to be able to use with Sinatra. They
are fully encapsulated from each other, and automatically registered with the
`Scarab::App` container application.
